The aim of this project is to produce an exact replica of the Newsweek homepage, focusing on responsiveness implemented with Twitter's Bootstrap framework. That means two things – using bootstrap CSS classes wherever possible (main point of this project) and double-checking that the page layout does not break on smaller screens.

## Built with
  * HTML 
  * CSS (Bootstrap)

## Getting started
**I created a cloned copy of [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/) homepage. The main aim is to ensure that proper bootstrap classes are used to implement responsiveness, so functionality is not a priority.**

I used the browser’s developer tools to inspect the archived apple website to understand how elements are placed and styled.
I built my own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. I carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside
  - Then open the [web page](https://www.newsweek.com/), inspect its features with browser's developer tools and start creating  :shipit:
